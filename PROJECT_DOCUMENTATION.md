# SmartShop - Intelligent Inventory Management System

## Project Overview
SmartShop is a full-stack inventory management system built with a React frontend and Python FastAPI backend. The system is designed to help businesses manage their inventory, track orders, monitor suppliers, and receive automated alerts for stock management.

## Architecture

### Backend (Python FastAPI)
Located in `/backend` directory, the backend follows a clean architecture pattern with the following components:

#### Directory Structure
```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── models/         # Database models (SQLAlchemy ORM)
│   ├── routes/         # API endpoints and route handlers
│   ├── schemas/        # Pydantic models for request/response validation
│   ├── services/       # Business logic layer
│   └── utils/          # Helper functions and utilities
├── scripts/            # Utility scripts (e.g., data seeding)
└── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
```

#### Key Components

1. **Models** (`/app/models/`)
   - `product.py`: Product inventory management
   - `supplier.py`: Supplier information and management
   - `order.py`: Order processing and tracking
   - `alert.py`: Inventory alerts and notifications

2. **Routes** (`/app/routes/`)
   - `products.py`: Product CRUD operations
   - `suppliers.py`: Supplier management endpoints
   - `orders.py`: Order processing endpoints
   - `alerts.py`: Alert management endpoints
   - `dashboard.py`: Analytics and reporting endpoints

3. **Services** (`/app/services/`)
   - `product_service.py`: Product business logic
   - `supplier_service.py`: Supplier management logic
   - `order_service.py`: Order processing logic
   - `alert_service.py`: Alert generation and management

4. **Utils** (`/app/utils/`)
   - `calculations.py`: Business calculations
   - `notifications.py`: Alert notification system
   - `sample_data.py`: Test data generation

### Frontend (React)
Located in `/frontend` directory, built with Create React App and follows component-based architecture:

#### Directory Structure
```
frontend/
├── public/            # Static assets
└── src/
    ├── components/    # React components
    │   ├── Common/    # Shared components
    │   └── Products/  # Product-specific components
    └── services/      # API integration services
```

#### Key Components

1. **Components**
   - `Navbar.jsx`: Navigation component
   - `ProductForm.jsx`: Product creation/editing
   - `ProductList.jsx`: Product listing and management

2. **Services**
   - `productService.js`: Product API integration

## Core Features

1. **Inventory Management**
   - Real-time stock tracking
   - Product categorization
   - Stock level monitoring
   - Automatic reorder point calculation

2. **Supplier Management**
   - Supplier profile management
   - Performance tracking
   - Order history
   - Contact information

3. **Order Processing**

   - Order status tracking
   - Order history
   - Automated reordering

4. **Alert System**
   - Low stock alerts
   - Order status notifications
   - Price change alerts
   - Supplier updates

## Technical Specifications

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18+
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **UI Components**: Custom components
- **API Integration**: Axios
- **Styling**: CSS Modules

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to `/backend`
2. Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate virtual environment:
   - Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Unix: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run server: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to `/frontend`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm start`
4. Access application at `http://localhost:3000`

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available at `/docs` when running the backend server. Key endpoints include:

- `GET /api/products`: List all products
- `POST /api/products`: Create new product
- `GET /api/suppliers`: List all suppliers
- `POST /api/orders`: Create new order
- `GET /api/alerts`: List active alerts

## Future Enhancements

1. **AI Integration Opportunities**
   - Demand forecasting using historical data
   - Automated supplier selection
   - Dynamic pricing optimization
   - Anomaly detection in inventory patterns
   - Smart reordering based on seasonal trends
   - Natural language processing for order processing
   - Visual recognition for product cataloging

2. **Planned Features**
   - Mobile application
   - Advanced analytics dashboard
   - Machine learning-based inventory optimization
   - Automated supplier communication
   - Real-time inventory tracking with IoT integration
   - Blockchain integration for supply chain transparency

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Style**
   - PEP 8 for Python code
   - ESLint configuration for JavaScript
   - Component-based architecture in React
   - Type hints in Python code
   - JSDoc documentation for JavaScript

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for backend services

   - Input validation

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypted data transmission
   - Secure password storage
   - Regular security audits
   - GDPR compliance measures

## Performance Optimization

1. **Backend**
   - Database query optimization
   - Caching strategies
   - Asynchronous processing
   - Connection pooling

2. **Frontend**
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading
   - Image optimization
   - Bundle size optimization
